# Coding With AI - Course Resources

Resources, prompts, lesson notes, feature specs, and more for the **Coding With AI** course — where we learn AI-assisted development by building **DevStash**, a centralized developer knowledge/resource hub.

> **Note:** This repo does NOT contain the DevStash source code. That lives in a [separate repository](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devstash). This is the companion resource for students taking the course.

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. **Follow along with the course** — Open the lesson notes in `course-lessons/` as you watch each video
2. **Copy prompts** — Use the prompts in `prompts/` as starting points when building alongside the course
3. **Reference specs** — Check `context/features/` for detailed feature specifications when implementing
4. **Set up your own skills** — Copy the `skills/` folder into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory
5. **Study the docs** — Read through `docs/` for architecture decisions and integration plans

---

## 🔄 Development Workflow

The workflow we follow throughout the course for every feature:

1. **Document** — Write the feature spec in `context/current-feature.md`
2. **Branch** — Create a new branch (`feature/[name]` or `fix/[name]`)
3. **Implement** — Build the feature with AI assistance
4. **Create Tests** - Create unit tests for server actions
5. **Run Tests** — Verify in the browser, run `npm run build` and `npm run test`
6. **Iterate** — Adjust as needed
7. **Commit** — Only after the build passes
8. **Merge** — Merge to main
9. **Delete Branch** — Clean up after merge
10. **Review** — Review AI-generated code
11. **Complete** — Mark as done in `current-feature.md`
